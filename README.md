# Kalki

> Decentralized. Self-evolving. Built by purpose, not control.

**Kalki** is an open-source initiative to build a modular, self-improving AI protocol that evolves with community input and ethical consensus. While it draws inspiration from cultural metaphors, the project is committed to staying technically rigorous, modular, and symbol-free in the codebase.

## Features

- 🧠 **Self-altering Core Engine**: A foundation for self-improving and updateable AI logic.
- 🛡️ **DAO Governance (Sabha)**: Transparent, decentralized governance for evolution and upgrades.
- 📦 **Modular Design**: Contributions in philosophical reasoning, engineering, ML models, and governance logic.
- 💰 **Tokenomics Layer (Kosha)**: Incentivization and voting powered by a native token (for future integration).
- 🌍 **Cultural Minimalism**: While terms like "Kalki" are used publicly, internal systems use conventional, technical terminology.
